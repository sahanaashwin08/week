# HTML (HyperText Markup Language):
    **Definition: HTML is the language used to build the structure of a webpage.**
    **It tells the browser what elements should appear: text boxes, buttons, headings, etc.**
    **In your calculator, HTML creates the display screen and the buttons for numbers and operations.**


# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):
    **Definition: CSS is used to control the design and appearance of the webpage.**
    **It decides colors, fonts, sizes, spacing, and layout.**
    **In your calculator, CSS makes the background gradient, styles the buttons, adds hover effects, and gives the calculator a modern look.**


# JavaScript (JS):
    **Definition: JavaScript is the programming language of the web.**
    **It adds logic and interactivity to the webpage.**
    **In your calculator, JavaScript makes the buttons work:**
             **When you press a number, it appears on the display.*
             **When you press =, it calculates the result.*
             **When you press C, it clears the display.**
             **When you press ⌫, it deletes the last character.**


# How It Runs Together:
  **The browser first reads the HTML → builds the calculator layout.*
  **Then it applies CSS → makes it look attractive and user-friendly.*
  **Finally, JavaScript runs → gives the calculator its working ability.*
  **When you open the file in a browser (like Chrome, Edge, Firefox), all three combine to show a functional calculator.**
